The average lifespan of a [Cinnamon Queen Chicken](https://animalop.com/cinnamon-queen-chicken/) is 3 to 7 years. A shorter lifespan is associated with hybrid breeds, but these birds can live for 10 years in ideal conditions.
Although they lay eggs all year, Cinnamon Queen hens tend to lay fewer as it gets colder. To keep egg production consistent, put a skylight in the coop.
